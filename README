PhotoGallery
============

This is the start of a Ruby on Rails photo gallery plugin.  You can see a live demo at http://plainlystated.com/photo_gallery

Detailed documentation can be found at http://plainlystated.com/projects/photo_gallery


Please feel free to try it out.  It works for me, but undoubtedly still needs some work to get it robust enough to work on all systems.  If you have success/problems, drop me a note at patrick@plainlystated.com
